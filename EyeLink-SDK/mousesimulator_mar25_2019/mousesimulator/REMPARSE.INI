# This file configures the on-line parser.
# It sets thresholds for saccade detection,

// TWO PARSER SETUPS: EACH MUST BE CONFIGURED
// You can choose between these configurations
// from the Set Options menu.

	;; This sets up the automatic parsing system for eye movements
	;; Numbers are degrees, deg/sec, deg/sec/sec,
	;; and milliseconds (multiples of 4 msec)

	;; these are used for saccade detection (degrees/second)
	;; generally, these settings should not have to be changed.
	;; Increasing saccade velocity to 30 degrees/sec
	;; will prevent detection of some saccedes <0.5 degree in size.
