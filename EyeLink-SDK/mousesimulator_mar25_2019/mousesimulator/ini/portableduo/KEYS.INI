	;; KEY FUNCTIONS
	;;
	;; Key specifiers: strings or characters
	;; seperated by '+' ('+' can also be a key description)
	;; Capitalization of strings is not significant
	;; Key modifiers are "shift","ctrl","alt", and key descriptor
	;; "shift" is detected independent of shiftlock
	;; For shifted symbols such as '#', use '#' and not 'shift+3'
	;; The modifier 'repeat' will allow key repeat to trigger commands
	;;
	;; Descriptors: 1..9, a..z, symbols, F1..F12,
	;; "ESC", "INS", "HOME", "PGUP", "PGDN", "DEL", "END",
	;; "UP", "DOWN", "LEFT", "RIGHT", "SPACE", "ENTER", "TAB"


	// KEY COMMAND DEFINITIONS
	## key_function <keyspec> <command>
	;; Keys may be used to generate commands.  Give a key description
	;; string followed by "reserve" if you wish lock out other use of
	;; the key. Follow this by a quoted command string, or none to 
	;; release key.
	;; <keyspec>: key name and modifiers. 
	;; <command>: command string to execute when key pressed
key_function ctrl+alt+q "exit_program"		;; keys to exit EyeLink

  	;; THIS IS REQUIRED FOR DEVELOPER'S KIT SAMPLE CODE 
   	;; RECORD ABORT MENU
   	
	## user_record_key_item <button_text> <description> <key_spec> [<optional command>]
 	;; Add any one key item to Output mode menu bar
user_record_key_item = " CTRL-ALT-A ", "Abort Trial  ", ctrl+alt+a, "display_user_menu 1"

	## display_user_menu <menu number>
	;; Starts a user menu, numbered from 1 to 3 (1 to 4 for EyeLink 1). 
	;; User menu 1 will be called up on record abort (CTRL-ALT-A) by the 
	;; API function record_abort_handler().
;; display_user_menu

  	;; Up to 4 user menus can be created.  These are accessed by
	;; 	display_user_menu <number=1..4>
  	;;
  	;; The menu description is started with
	;; 	create_user_menu <number=1..4> <title>
  	;;
  	;; and each line is added with
	;; 	add_user_menu_item <button_text> <description> <key_spec> <code> [<optional command>]
  	;;
  	;; When the menu is entered, it stays there till the tracker is
  	;; switched to another mode, and monitors key presses.
  	;; If identified, the code is sent to the remote PC,
  	;; and any command is executed.
