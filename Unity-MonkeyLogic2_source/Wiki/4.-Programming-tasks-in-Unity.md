# Unity
In this section we will describe the entire process of creating a new task, the **world famous XMaze**. The process described is creates the task **from scratch**, normally you would copy an existing task and modify it. This is just to illustrate how every single piece needs to be put together to create a whole task. 

#### Open Unity
Once everything is installed, launch the UnityHub, in the Projects tab click the Add button and select the installation directory used to Git install the MTLab_UnitySource repository. Then open the project.
 
#### Setting up the environment.
1. `File > Open Scene` and select `..\Assets\Tasks\XMazeTask\XMaze_Empty.unity`. This scene only has the ground and a light source. 
2. To group the walls of the maze, right click on the `Environment` GameObject and select `Create Empty`. 
3. Select the newly created `GameObject` and rename it `XMazeWalls`. 
4. To simplify things for later, move it to the center of the Terrain by setting its transform position to: 
    * X: 500
    * Y: 0
    * Z: 500
5. In the `Project Explorer` navigate to `..\Assets\Tasks\XMazeTask\WallMeshes\`, then drag each `X_****Walls_Internal` object **on** the `XMazeWalls` GameObject. The objects are too big and misplaced, set their scale and positions like so: 
    * East and West walls: Scale = 0.025 all axes, X and Z positions = 0, Y Position = 12.75
    * North and South walls: Scale = 0.025 all axes, X and Z positions = 0, Y Position = 6.35
6. By default the meshes don't have colliders so players can walk straight through them. To add one, click on the triangle next to the X_****Walls_Internal object in the hierarchy to expand its children. You should see a GameObject named `default` with already a `Mesh Renderer` and `Mesh Filter` components. Rename the GameObject from 'default' to "****Wall" then click `Add Component` and select `Mesh Collider`. Repeat for all walls. Renaming the `default` names is important because we send the instance IDs over the ML_FrameData for player collisions and gaze targets. At the same time we send a dictionnary mapping colliders' instance ID to their name. If all collider objects are named default, we won't know which is which when looking at the frame data.  

#### Player Controller
At this point we have an environment, but the `Game` view doesn't work since we do not have a camera, nor a way to move about in the environment. 
1. We need a PlayerController. Start by creating an Empty GameObject and renaming it PlayerController. 
2. Let's attach our first custom script. Select the PlayerController GameObject and click on the `Add Component` button of the `Inspector`, then select `Scripts > First Person > Player Controller`. This should add the `Player Controller` script as well as an `Audio Source` and a `Character Controller`. Set the `Min Move Distance` of the `Character Controller` to 0. 
3. Set the PlayerController position to (482, 1.08, 500) and its Y rotation to 90.
4. It is still missing a `Rigid Body` component to tell the other objects that it can collide with them. Attach it and set the `Angular Drag` to 0 and check the `Is Kinematic` box.
5. To add a Camera to our PlayerController, simply right click on the GameObject in the Hierarchy and select `Camera`. Set its Y position to 0.8, the `FOV Axis` to Horizontal and `Field of View` to 90. Make sure its `Tag` is "MainCamera".

To be able to move, we also need to create an InputController and assign its reference to our PlayerController. 

6. Create an Empty GameObject, rename it `InputController`, attach the `User Input Controller` component to it. In `Device Type` select `Keyboard` and set the `Turn Sensivity` to 1.  
7. Now to assign the `User Input Controller` reference to our `PlayerController` (red rectangle), select the PlayerController GameObject, then drag the `InputController` GameObject from the Hierarchy view to the `Input Ctrl` section of the PlayerController script in the Inspector. If you struggle to keep the PlayerController selected in the Inspector window, you can lock it by clicking on the padlock (green square) before dragging the InputController.

![UserInputCtrl](https://github.com/Doug1983/MTLab_UnitySource/blob/master/Documentation/img/UsrInputCtrl.jpg)

Hitting the Play button now should allow you to move about in the environment using the arrow keys on the keyboard and live the life changing experience of the XMaze environment. If not, you can load the XMaze_Step1.unity scene and compare it with what you have. 

#### Task design
Now that we have a way to explore, we need to define the behavior of the task, from start to end of trials. Let's break it down: 
* The task requires the subject to learn via trial and error a context dependent color-reward hierarchy. There are two contexts with 3 colors associated with either a High, Middle and Low reward value. The color hierarchy of context 1 is simply reversed in context 2. For example, if context 1 hierarchy is Red > Green > Blue, then context 2 is Blue > Green > Red. 
* Start of Trial: since these trials are continuous, nothing to do except to load the current trial conditions. If it is the first trial or after a "timeout", then move the subject to the default start position. 
* Contextual cue onset: once the subject reaches the central corridor, the walls' texture change to display the current contextual information.
* Force point of view: when leaving the central corridor towards the target section, we force the subject's orientation and position to have the exact same point of view (POV) on each trial, to match stimuli onsets. 
* Targets onset: once the proper POV is set, display the two targets.
* Response and End of trial: wait for target selection and terminate trial (i.e. remove targets and textures). Note that the feedback is provided in MonkeyLogic. 

We also need to keep in mind that successive trials alternate in a North->South; South->North pattern, so we need to define the proper trigger volumes and show the targets at the proper position. 

#### Experiment props
Before setting the ExperimentController, State System Animator and TaskInfo classes, we need actual objects in the scene to serve as targets and triggers. From the breakdown above, we'll need triggers to show the cues and targets, the targets themselves and markers for their possible positions. This implementation is slightly different from the original one as we will rely on a single trigger for both target and context onset. We'll need this for both the north and south direction, so that's 2 triggers, 1 target and 1 distractor objects and 4 possible positions. We already have the walls loaded to display the cue textures. 
1. Start by creating an empty GameObject and naming it `ExperimentProps` to group all objects. Again set its transform position to the the center of the environment (X: 500, Y:0, Z:500).
2. Within this group, create three other groups named: `Positions`, `Targets` and `Triggers`. Make sure their transforms are at (0,0,0).

The various position values given here might be confusing, but there is one important detail: **in the inspector, position values are RELATIVE to ALL parent objects**. Meaning that the ABSOLUTE position in world coordinates of the `Positions` GameObject is: parent's position (i.e. ExperimentProps: 500,0,500) + current local transform of (0,0,0) = (500,0,500). These values are added for each parent level.

Moving on, we will start with `Positions`. We need a `StartPosition` and 4 possible Target positions: NorthEast, NorthWest, SouthEast and SouthWest. However, since the only randomization between trials are the East-West positions of the target/distractor duo, we will create the following 4 position markers: `North`, `South`, `East`,and `West`. 

We'll define North as the positive X axis, making West the positive Z axis. 

3. Since position markers require only a Transform, we'll create empty GameObjects. Right click on the `Positions` GameObject and create 4 empty GameObjects named: `North`, `South`, `East` and `West`. Set their positions to (+-34.75, 0, 0) for North(+) and South(-), and (0, 0, +- 10) for East(-) and West(+). Then create another empty GameObject, name it StartPosition and place it at (-18, 1.08, 0). 

Little issue, we don't see our markers if we de-select them, so add a `Display Marker` component and set the `Marker Type` to `Target` or `Start`. The actual values don't mean anything in terms of experiments, they just set different colors for convenience. 

4. To create our Target/Distractor pair, right click on the `Targets` GameObject and select `3D Object > Cylinder`, set its name to `Target` and its position to (34.75, 0, 10) and its scale to (4, 0.1, 4). 
5. Repeat for `Distractor`. 
6. By default, cylinder objects are assigned a capsule collider (i.e. pill shaped) so we need to set it as a trigger to prevent the collider from blocking subject movement. You can set the values for multiple objects simultaneously: select the two GameObjects and in the Inspector, under `Capsule Collider`, check the `Is Trigger` property. 

To create the triggers, we'll create Empty GameObjects and only add a `Box Collider` to them. We don't need them to be visible or have textures. 

7. Create an Empty GameObject under the `Triggers` group, rename it N_Trigger, set its position to (15.85, 0.75, 0), scale to (0.5, 1.6, 3), and on the added `Box Collider` component, check the `Is Trigger` property. Add a `Display Marker` component and set its type to Trigger.
8. Right click on the `N_Trigger` trigger and select `Duplicate`. Change its name to `S_Trigger` and set its X position to -15.85. 

You can also make the markers visible in the Game view by enabling `Gizmos` in the top menu. 

You can compare what you have now with XMaze_Step2.unity. 

#### Task Info
Now let's get this show on the road. 

1. Create an empty GameObject and call it `XMaze_ExperimentCtrl`. We don't really care about its transform but it's good practice to set it to (0,0,0). 
2. Since the ExperimentController class depends on the TaskInfo one to work, we will create this script first. Right click on `XMaze_ExperimentCtrl` and create an empty GameObject called `XMaze_TaskInfo`. 
3. We now need to create the custom script to attach to our XMaze_TaskInfo object. In the Project explorer panel, navigate to `..\Assets\Tasks\XMazeTask\`, right click `Create > C# Script`. Name it `XMaze_TaskInfo`. Once created, double click on the file, this should launch Microsoft Visual Studio and open your script. This is what you should see: 
```C#
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class XMaze_TaskInfo: MonoBehaviour
{
    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        
    }
}
```
3. The first step is to make our script inherit from the base-class `TaskInfo` to get the default behavior. So replace `public class XMaze_TaskInfo : MonoBehaviour` with `public class XMaze_TaskInfo : TaskInfo`.
4. We will now add a few custom task parameters. Normally the XMaze tasks yields a graded reward, proportional to the color value. In some cases we might want to have a "non-graded" reward where the subject is only rewarded if the higher valued color is selected. To add the necessary properties, go below the opening `{` and add: 
```C#
// Graded or all/nothing reward
public bool GradedReward = true; 
// Position Markers
public GameObject NorthMarker;
public GameObject SouthMarker;
public GameObject NorthTrigger;
public GameObject SouthTrigger;
// Materials for context 2 and color hierarchy
public Material Ctx_One;
public Material High_CtxOne;
public Material Mid_CtxOne;
public Material Low_CtxOne;
// Materials for context 2 and color hierarchy
public Material Ctx_Two;
public Material High_CtxTwo;
public Material Mid_CtxTwo;
public Material Low_CtxTwo;
```

While the next step is not necessary, it is a good example of the possible use of the `OnValidate` function call. The OnValidate function is called every time a parameter is changed in the Unity Inspector GUI. By default, the TaskInfo class has a list of `Condition` variables, specifying the cue material, the correct target material and incorrect distractor one. Instead of setting all these combinations by hand, we will program a way to automatically generate the context-color hierarchy pairs. Remember that we do not need to define our `Conditions` variable as it is inherited from the base TaskInfo class.
 
5. Now replace the empty function definitions for `Start` and `Update` with this custom validation function: 
```C#
private void OnValidate()
{
    // Call the validate function of base-class TaskInfo.
    // Note that we do not use base.OnValidate() as this function
    // is not "virtual" so we are not "overridding" it. 
    BaseValidate();

    // Generate the Condition list for the two contexts. 
    // The possible trial conditions are: 
    //    Ctx 1/2: High-Low, High-Mid, Mid-Low
    // Yielding 6 possible types. Keeping in mind that East-West positions are
    // randomized during trial preparation. 
    // The "Condition" structure is defined in TaskInfo.cs and it contains
    // a material variable for the Context Texture, as well as material arrays
    // for targets and distractors textures. The "Conditions" variable in an array
    // of conditions. We need to populate these arrays:
    // Create a 6 element Conditions array
    Conditions = new Condition[6];

    // Context 1; 
    // Create a new Condition structure and define its values between the { }
    Conditions[0] = new Condition
    {
        CueMaterial = Ctx_One,
        TargetMaterials = new Material[1] { High_CtxOne },
        DistractorMaterials = new Material[1] { Low_CtxOne }
    };
    Conditions[1] = new Condition
    {
        CueMaterial = Ctx_One,
        TargetMaterials = new Material[1] { High_CtxOne },
        DistractorMaterials = new Material[1] { Mid_CtxOne }
    };
   Conditions[2] = new Condition
   {
        CueMaterial = Ctx_One,
        TargetMaterials = new Material[1] { Mid_CtxOne },
        DistractorMaterials = new Material[1] { Low_CtxOne }
    };
    Conditions[3] = new Condition
    {
        CueMaterial = Ctx_Two,
        TargetMaterials = new Material[1] { High_CtxTwo },
        DistractorMaterials = new Material[1] { Low_CtxTwo }
    };
    Conditions[4] = new Condition
    {
        CueMaterial = Ctx_Two,
        TargetMaterials = new Material[1] { High_CtxTwo },
        DistractorMaterials = new Material[1] { Mid_CtxTwo }
    };
    Conditions[5] = new Condition
    {
        CueMaterial = Ctx_Two,
        TargetMaterials = new Material[1] { Mid_CtxOne },
        DistractorMaterials = new Material[1] { Low_CtxTwo }
    };
}
```
6. After saving our XMaze_TaskInfo.cs file and returning to Unity, the engine will automatically recompile our scripts. We can now assign our identically named component to the `XMaze_TaskInfo` object. Once you do, you should see a bunch of parameters appear. Like so: 

![XMaze TaskInfo](https://github.com/Doug1983/MTLab_UnitySource/blob/master/Documentation/img/XMaze_TaskInfo.jpg)

Most of the documentation for the basic properties will appear in form of ToolTips (i.e. hover your mouse over the property name), if not, it's in the script itself. To explore the TaskInfo script hierarchy in Visual studio, open your XMaze_TaskInfo.cs script, select the word `TaskInfo` in the inheritance definition and hit F12. This should open the TaskInfo.cs script file. This works for every class, variable or function, F12 navigates to its definition.

7. Back in the Unity Editor, let's set the parameters of XMaze_TaskInfo. **Keep in mind that you can always "lock" the Inspector by clicking on the padlock icon. It makes dragging and dropping easier.** 
    * Set the `Size` of `Start Positions` to 1. You should see `Element 0` with a value of `None (Game Object)` appear underneath. This means that it is not defined and expects an object reference of the `GameObject` class. Now drag the `StartPosition` GameObject over that field to set the reference. 
    * Check `Continuous Trials` as we do not want an inter-trial interval.
    * Set the `Ignore Penalty` to 5. This will add a 5 seconds delay to the Inter Trial Interval when time out trials occur. 
    * Leave `Fixation Objects`, `Screen Fixation Offsets` and `World Fixation Offsets` empty (i.e. `Size = 0`). We don't need fixation points. 
    * We do not need `Cue Onset Triggers` now, we will define them during task execution
    * Set the `Cue Objects` `Size` to 2 and assign `X_EastWalls_Internal` to `Element 0` and `X_WestWalls_Internal` to `Element 1`. 
    * Leave `Target Onset Triggers` empty. 
    * Set `Target Objects` `Size` to 1 and add our `Target` GameObject. Repeat for `Distractor`. 
    * `Possible Positions` are the and `East` and `West` GameObjects. 
    * Set `N Targets` and `N Distractors` to 1. This sets the number of presented targets/distractors for each trial. For example, you could set 12 `Target Objects` and display 5 at a time for each trial. But this is for a different task. 
    
Now to properly fill in the Context and Color Hierarchies we need to create materials for the context. Colors are already created. 

8. In the Project explorer `..\Assets\Tasks\XMazeTask\` create a `Materials` directory and two Materials inside. One named Wood and the other Steel.
9. Select the Wood material. Click on the little circle next to the word `Albedo` and in the window, search for "wood" and select it. Set both `Metallic` and `Smoothness` to 0 and uncheck `Reflections`. Do the same for "Steel". 
10. Now in the `XMaze_TaskInfo` set the Ctx_One to the `Wood` material and Ctx_Two to `Steel`. You should see your `Conditions` being populated automatically. 
11. You can find the colors Materials in `..\Assets\Materials\`. Set High_CtxOne and Low_CtxTwo to `Red`, Mid_CtxOne and Mid_CtxTwo to `Blue`, and Low_CtxOne and High_CtxTwo to `Purple`. 
12. Drag and drop the North/South Position markers and triggers to their respective spot in the TaskInfo inspector. 

At this point it might not be obvious what we are doing. To summarize, we have just provided the Experiment Controller with a list of all necessary GameObjects to be used in trials. In its default implementation, the Experiment Controller has a script that will iterate through all the possible combinations and permutations of these GameObjects, to generate a shuffled list of all possible trials. This list is replicated `Number Of Sets` times to allow for good trial to trial variability. A single element from that list is sampled on every trial to define the current condition.  

#### Experiment Controller
Now that our TaskInfo is fully defined, we can program the ExperimentController behavior. 

1. Create a `XMaze_ExperimentCtrl` C# script the same way you did for the XMaze_TaskInfo.
2. Open the script and set the inheritance from `ExperimentController`. 
3. The ExperimentController needs a reference to the TaskInfo object in order to get the task parameters and generate trials. Delete the Update funciton and add the following code: 
```C#
// public variable of the XMaze_TaskInfo class.
public XMaze_TaskInfo xTaskInfo;

// OnEnable and OnDisable function calls are important because they connect the
// experiment controller with the events controller for communication across classes. 
private new void OnEnable()
{
    // Important, do not remove ---
    base.OnEnable();
    taskInfo = xTaskInfo;
    // ----------------------------
}

// This function allows the base-class Experiment Controller to 
// access variables defined here (e.g. the IsNorth boolean). The returned value 
// needs to be converted into the proper format with (format) before: 
// bool ReturnedIsNorth = (bool)returnValue("IsNorth");
public override object ReturnValue(string name)
{
    return GetType().GetProperty(name).GetValue(this);
}

private void Start()
{
    // Base function call. Do not remove. 
    base.Initialize();
}
```
4. Return in Unity Editor add an `Animator` and a `XMaze_ExperimentCtrl` components to the `XMaze_ExperimentCtrl` GameObject. In the ExperimentCtrl component add the references to the XMaze_TaskInfo and PlayerController GameObjects. 

#### State System
We can now create our Animator state system to define the different stages of our task. 

1. In the Project view in `..\Assets\Tasks\XMazeTask\` create a new `Animator Controller` and call it `XMaze_StateSystem`. Once created, drag it to the `Controller` field of the `Animator` component of the XMaze_ExperimentCtrl GameObject, then double click on it, it should launch the Animator window. This is what you should see:

![Empty Animator](https://github.com/Doug1983/MTLab_UnitySource/blob/master/Documentation/img/Empty_Animator.JPG)

On the left is the `Parameters` panel. Parameters are simply Animator variables that can be set and read to trigger transitions across states. 

2. We need 4 `Trigger` parameters: Run, Stop, StateOver, TrialOver. Create them using the "+" button. 
3. Right click in the `Base Layer` window and select `Create Empty` to create an Empty State. By default the first state is orange and automatically connects to the green `Entry` node (i.e. when playing). Rename the state `WaitForML`. 
4. Create another Emtpy state and rename it `InterTrialInterval`. It is not connected to anything so we need to create a transition from the `WaitForML` state to the `InterTrialInterval`. The behavior we want is that when we hit the play button, the state system stays in the `WaitForML` state until it receives the eye calibration values and starts the experiment. The first step of any trial is the ITI. 
5. Create a transition by right clicking on the `WaitForML` state and selecting `Make Transition`. A white arrow should follow your mouse now. Then click on `InterTrialInterval`. You now have a link between the two states. 
6. Click on the white arrow and set the properties like so: uncheck `Has Exit Time`, keep `Fixed Duration` checked and set the `Transition Duration` to 0. 
7. Now add a condition by clicking the `+` button under the `Conditions` tab and select `Run`. This means that when the `Run` Trigger is set, it will start the experiment. 
8. We need the WaitForML state to actually do something, so let's add `Behaviours` to it. Start by selecting it, then hit the `Add Behaviour` button. Add the `SetupPhase` and `StateSystemCommon` behaviours. The `SetupPhase` behavior has no parameter. Set the `StateSystemCommon` parameters to: State Name = Setup, Min State Duration = 0, Max State Duration = -1, Requires Fixation = False, Trigger Type = None. Max State Duration of -1 means infinite duration. It will not transition because of elapsed time.
9. Add the `InterTrialInterval` and `StateSystemCommon` behaviours to the InterTrialInterval state. Set the `StateSystemCommon` parameters to: State Name = ITI, Min State Duration = 0, Max State Duration = 0, Requires Fixation = False, Trigger Type = None. 
10. Repeat the same operations to create a `StartOfTrial` state, assign it the `StartOfTrial` and `StateSystemCommon` behaviors. Set the StateSystemCommon properties to: State Name = Start Of Trial, Min/Max Duration = 0, Fixation = False and Trigger = None. 
11. Create a transition from ITI to Start Of Trial: Has Exit Time = False, Fixed Durtaion = True, Duration = 0, Conditions =  StateOver. 

Now that the trial has started, we need to wait for as long as it takes for the subject to hit the Cue Onset Triggers. This will be the Delay_1 state: 

12. Create `Delay_1` state and only assing a StateSystemCommon behavior with the properties: State Name = Delay_1, Min State Duration = 0, Max State Duration = -1, Trigger Type = Cue. This means that the state will last until the subject hits the collider of a GameObject defined in TaskInfo's CueOnsetTriggers.
13. From now on all transitions have the same parameters: no exit time, duration = 0 and a StateOver condition. Make the transition from Start Of Trial to Delay_1. 
14. Create a `Cue` State with CueOnset (Hide Cue = false) and StateSystemCommon behaviors (Name = Cue, Duration = 0, Trigger = None) and a `Delay_2` state with only a StateSystemCommon behavior (Name = Delay_2, duration 0, Trigger = Targets). Add the proper transitions.

#### FOV Forcing
At this point, we've reached where the Field Of View should be re-directed to be consistent across trials. However, the script for this behavior doesn't exist, yet! Don't worry, the core components have been added to the non-modifiable scripts. 

We will do this by first blocking subject input from updating the rotation and backward movement (i.e. can only move forward). We will then create a custom State Behaviour that will get the player position and rotation and update it to have the proper rotation at a pre-defined position.

1. Create an empty state (with a transition from Delay_2) and name it `ForceFOV`. In the Add Behavior menu, select `FreezePhase` and open the script. This script calls the ExperimentController `FreezePlayer` function on state enter and on state exit. And if we look at the function definition (i.e. selecting it and pressing F12), it is `virtual` and completely blocks player movement. Let's `override` it.
2. Open the XMaze_ExperimentCtrl.cs script and add the following lines: 
```C#
public override void FreezePlayer(bool ON)
{
    // if ON==true then player rotation and backward movement are frozen
    playerController.FreezeRotation(ON);
    playerController.ConstrainForward(ON);
}
``` 

During this overridden phase, the player won't be able to move backward nor turn. This is a very good example for the virtual/override pair. If the `FreezePlayer` function wasn't defined in the ExperimentController, we could not have a `FreezePhase` already defined. It couldn't find the function within the ExperimentController class and would create an error during compilation. But now we can have a default behavior for pre-existing state system states and the possibility to change it when needed. No need to create new classes or scripts. 

3. While we are adding code to the XMaze_ExperimentCtrl class, it is a good time to add a variable to keep track whether it is a North or South directed trial. We need other scripts to access it, so it would need to be `public`, but we only want the experiment controller to be able to modify it. We'll make it "read-only" by adding these lines above the `OnEnable` function definition: 
```C#
public bool IsNorth { get; protected set; }
```

These lines leave "**get**ting" the variable value public, but limit the accessibility for "**set**ting" its value to ExperimentController and its sub-classes. 

4. Back in the Animator window, in the `Add Behaviour` menu of the ForceFOV state, select `New Script` and name it XMaze_ForceFOV. Make sure the script is located in the `\Tasks\XMazeTask` directory. 
5. Open the script. Default State behaviors are already written but commented out. 

This script will be responsible for setting the position and rotation smoothly as the subject approaches the final target onset position. We will define this position as a coordinate on the X (i.e. North-South) and Z (i.e. East-West) axes, and make it editable in the Animator window. We also need a final player rotation value for both position. 

6. Copy and paste this script in the newly created XMaze_ForceFOV.cs file. Explanations for each line are in the comments: 
```C#
using UnityEngine;

public class XMaze_ForceFOV : StateMachineBehaviour
{
    // X, "Z" coordinates for target onset
    // 2D vectors use x and y, we will assing z value to y.
    // Remember that values set here are only the "default" values, they 
    // are fully editable in the Inspector GUI as they are "public". 
    public Vector2 N_OnsetPosition = new Vector2 { x = 519.75f, y = 500f };  
    public Vector2 S_OnsetPosition = new Vector2 { x = 480.25f, y = 500f };

    // Orientations at target onset in degrees
    public float N_OnsetRotation = 90;  
    public float S_OnsetRotation = 270;

    // Default rates
    public float default_rotation_rate = 1f;
    public float default_translation_rate = 0.1f;

    // keep current trial targets 
    private Vector2 target_Position;
    private float target_Rotation;

    // Distance at which rates start speeding up
    private float start_DistanceX = 5f;
    
    // Is North?
    private bool isNorth;

    // OnStateEnter is called when a transition starts and the state machine starts to evaluate this state
    override public void OnStateEnter(Animator animator, AnimatorStateInfo stateInfo, int layerIndex)
    {
        // To get the current value for the IsNorth boolean, which is held in the XMaze_ExperimentCtrl class, not
        // in the base ExperimentController, we have to use the ReturnValue function. We want a boolean value
        // so we have to explicitely convert it using (bool) before the returned value
        isNorth = (bool)ExperimentController.instance.ReturnValue("IsNorth");

        // Get the current playercontroller transform and its position
        Transform currentPos = ExperimentController.instance.playerController.transform;

        // Distance is absolute value
        if (isNorth)
        {
            target_Position = N_OnsetPosition;
            target_Rotation = N_OnsetRotation;
        }
        else
        {
            target_Position = S_OnsetPosition;
            target_Rotation = S_OnsetRotation;
        }
    }

    // OnStateUpdate is called on each Update frame between OnStateEnter and OnStateExit callbacks
    override public void OnStateUpdate(Animator animator, AnimatorStateInfo stateInfo, int layerIndex)
    {
        // Get the current updated position
        Transform currentPos = ExperimentController.instance.playerController.transform;
        Vector3 angles = currentPos.eulerAngles;
        Vector3 position = currentPos.position;

        // If the current position is > target position, force end state
        if ((isNorth && currentPos.position.x >= target_Position.x) || (!isNorth && currentPos.position.x <= target_Position.x))
        {
            angles.y = target_Rotation;
            position.z = target_Position.y;
            ExperimentController.instance.playerController.transform.eulerAngles = angles;
            ExperimentController.instance.playerController.transform.position = position;

            // replaces the StateSystem common behavior which is set to Infinite time, 
            // no triggers. This is where the state ends. 
            animator.SetTrigger("StateOver");

        if (dist_to_targ <=5)
        {

}
```

7. Finally add a StateSystemCommon behavior to the state (Name= Force FOV, Min duration= 0, Max duration =-1, Trigger = None). This means that the StateSystemCommon will never trigger the state transition, but we will rely on the ForceFOV behavior to handle that part when the target postion is reached. 
8. Add a "Target" state with TargetOnset, DistractorOnset and StateSystemCommon (Name = Target, Min/Max duration = 0, Trigger= None) and its transition. 
9. Add a "Response" state with ResponseOnset and StateSystemCommon (Name= Response, Max duration = -1, trigger = None) and its transition. 
10. Add a "EndOFTrial" state with EndOfTrial and StateSystemCommon (Name= End Of Trial, Durations = 0, Triggers = None) behaviors. For the **transition** from the Response state, set HasExitTime = false, duration = 0 and the **condition** to `TrialOver`. Then add a normal transition back to InterTrialInterval (condition = StateOver). 
11. From the `Any State` cyan node, add a transition to EndOfTrial with a "TrialOver" condition.

#### Graded Reward
We need to append some code to the `EndOfTrial` function to add the "Graded Reward" behavior necessary for the XMaze task. Normally a trial outcome is binary, correct or incorrect, but in the XMaze, the size of the reward does not depend on the "correctness" of the selection, but purely on its color and context. To implement this script we will check which is the current context and whether the selected object (i.e. the Outcome variable for correct/target or incorrect/distractor) is rewarded or not. In the XMaze_ExperimentCtrl script add:

```C#
public override void EndTrial()
{
    // If Graded reward is selected, change outcomes, keep correct/incorrect
    // otherwise. 
    if (xMazeTaskInfo.GradedReward)
    {
        // We need to check all trial outcomes since both a "correct" or a 
        // "incorrect" outcome could yield the same reward size, depending 
        // on the presented colors. 

        // correct == highest reward selected
        // correct_mid == middle reward selected when low reward was present
        // correct_low == impossible

        // incorrect_high == impossible
        // incorrect_mid == middle reward selected when high reward was present
        // incorrect == lowest reward selected

        // Subject selected the target object
        if (Outcome == "correct")
        {
            if (_currentTrial.Target_Materials[0] == xMazeTaskInfo.Mid_CtxOne ||
                _currentTrial.Target_Materials[0] == xMazeTaskInfo.Mid_CtxTwo)
            {
               Outcome = "correct_mid";
            }
        }
        // subject selected the distractor
        else if (Outcome == "incorrect")
        {
            if (_currentTrial.Distractor_Materials[0] == xMazeTaskInfo.Mid_CtxOne ||
                _currentTrial.Distractor_Materials[0] == xMazeTaskInfo.Mid_CtxTwo)
            {
                Outcome = "incorrect_mid";
            }
        }
    }
    // We don't want to replace the script, only build on it
    // So we call the base function. 
    base.EndTrial();
}
```

#### North and South
At this point, the only thing missing is the handling of the North vs South trials. Indeed, the East-West positions of the target/distractor pair has been handled by the existing scripts and the task info "Possible Postions". But if we were to run things now, the disks would appear **on** the East-West markers, outside of the maze. We need to give them a North-South position. Similarly, both N(S)_Trigger can be used to toggle cues and targets. We need to define which is which for the specific trial direction. 

1. To do this we'll override the `PrepareTrial` function in the XMaze_ExperimentCtrl script: 
```C#
public override void PrepareTrial()
{
    // Most of this is copy pasted from the base function. 

    // get current trial
    _currentTrial = _allTrials[_trialNumber];
    // increment counter after since we number trials 1: but indices are 0:
    _trialNumber++;
    _currentTrial.Trial_Number = _trialNumber;
    
    // teleport player to the start position if the previous trial was
    // a timeout (the player should be OnBlack at this time).
    if (!taskInfo.ContinuousTrials || _previousTrialError == 2)
    {
        // initial rotation is 90 degrees in the Y axis
        Quaternion initialRotation = Quaternion.identity;
        initialRotation.eulerAngles = new Vector3 { x = 0, y = 90, z = 0};
        playerController.ToStart(_currentTrial.Start_Position, initialRotation);
        
        // if we teleport the player to the start postion, this trial is a "North"
        // trial
        IsNorth = true;
    }
    else
    {
        // Toggle North-South Trials
        IsNorth = !IsNorth;
    }

    // Prepare cues and targets. 
    PrepareCues(); // Empty for this example, cue objects remain visible. 

    // In the PrepareTargets/Distractors script, we place the objects at the selected position
    // from the TaskInfo. Our position markers don't differentiate between North/South and are located
    // outside the maze. We need to set the proper X position value. Same with the cue/target onset 
    // triggers. 
    float xPosition;

    if (IsNorth)
    {
        xPosition = taskInfo.NorthMarker.transform.position.x;

        // On a North bound trial, the cue trigger is the south one
        // and the target trigger is the north one
        taskInfo.CueOnsetTriggers = new GameObject[1] { taskInfo.SouthTrigger };
        taskInfo.TargetOnsetTriggers = new GameObject[1] { taskInfo.NorthTrigger };
    }
    else
    {
        xPosition = taskInfo.SouthMarker.transform.position.x;
        taskInfo.CueOnsetTriggers = new GameObject[1] { taskInfo.NorthTrigger };
        taskInfo.TargetOnsetTriggers = new GameObject[1] { taskInfo.SouthTrigger };
    }

    // Set values for current trial.
    for (int i = 0; i < _currentTrial.Target_Positions.Length; i++)
    {
        _currentTrial.Target_Positions[i].x = xPosition;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < _currentTrial.Distractor_Positions.Length; i++)
    {
        _currentTrial.Distractor_Positions[i].x = xPosition;
    }

    // This will position the game objects and assign their texture, but hide them
    // and disable their collider.
    PrepareTargets();
    PrepareDistractors();

    // Sanity checks
    TrialEnded = false;
    Outcome = "aborted";
}
```

#### MonkeyLogic, EyeLink and Display controllers
To enable the MonkeyLogic or EyeLink interface, simply create an empty GameObject under the XMaze_ExperimentCtrl, rename it appropriately and add the `MonkeyLogicController` or `EyeLinkController` component to it. 

To enable fullscreen view and add the option for a photodiode flash, go to `Assets\Scripts\ViewInEditor\` in the project explorer and drag the DisplayController prefab on the XMaze_ExperimentCtrl GameObject. 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANNNNND we're done!

#### Task programming debrief
Keep in mind that this example is kind of a worst case scenario. It contains a lot of parameters that aren't required on a normal task. For most experiments the triggers and positions will be static and won't require specific task info or experiment controller behaviors. It is also very unlikely that you'll need to program a custom state system script.

But taking the time to understand why and how we did things here is truly important to understand how the system works and how the pieces all fit together.
