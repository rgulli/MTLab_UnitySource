## Network 
All the computers (i.e. **MonkeyLogic**, **Unity**, **Cerebus** and **EyeLink**) are now connected via an Ethernet **Switch**, meaning that they all have access to each other. This will, for example, enable Unity to directly receive eye data from the **EyeLink** computer and compute gaze targets on the fly, or to receive neural data from the **Cerebus** computer to be used in a closed-loop experiment. 

Network communication is handled by the LabStreamingLayer (LSL) suite which is described elsewhere (TODO: add link to section).

As a side note, the **NSP(s)** from BlackRock have a static IP address that we cannot change, this means two things: 
1. For a single **NSP** to be used in a closed-loop system, it can be wired directly in the Ethernet **Switch**
2. For a system with 2 **NSPs**, they have to be wired directly into the **Cerebus** computer, which will require a third Ethernet port to be connected to the **Switch**. 

## Unity computer
The **Unity** computer receives input devices commands (e.g. joystick) and handles all aspects of the VR environment and behavioral tasks. Its main interfaces are with the other computers via LSL and TCP/IP protocols. 

While it can run on a single display, it is possible to use two monitors, one for the subject view and the other for an experimenter interface which displays gaze position, collider volumes and other information. 

## MonkeyLogic computer
The **MonkeyLogic** computer reads the current state of the **Unity** VR task and handles data storage to disk, reward delivery and communication with neural acquisition hardware. It can be used to start/stop and pause/resume the experiment, but otherwise has no control over the Unity VR experiments and their parameters. 

Outside of network connections, the **MonkeyLogic** computer interfaces with the **NSPs** via the **National Instrument Board**, to send words (e.g. start of trial) and align behavior with neural data. The **NI Board** also sends the reward signal to the juicer via a BNC cable. 

This computer requires two displays, one for the control GUI and a second, shared via a **Splitter** box with the **Unity** computer to display stimuli for MonkeyLogic only tasks. 

## EyeLink computer
The **EyeLink** computer simply handles eye data processing and can be accessed by the **MonkeyLogic** and **Unity** computers simultaneously. The former handles the calibration and high rate recording of gaze data, while the latter processes the most recent gaze sample on every frame to compute which virtual objects are being foveated on. 

While faster rates are possible, 500 Hz for eye data acquisition seems to give the best compromise between speed and reliability (e.g. duplicated/dropped samples).

## Cerebus computer
The **Cerebus** computer handles the neural data acquisition and storage, **NSPs** control and configuration. In turn, the **NSPs** receive neural data from the pre-amplifier and head-stage, as well as **photodiode** information and **monekyLogic** words to synchronize neural data with stimuli presentation.
