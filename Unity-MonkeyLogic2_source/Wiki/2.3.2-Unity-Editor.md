## Game Objects
In Unity, each individual environment is called a _Scene_. 

Every single entity present in a scene is represented by a _GameObject_. Contrary to what the name might suggest, a _GameObject_ isn't necessarily an individual object (i.e. a single class instance), but acts as a container for multiple _Components_. 

A _Component_ is (circularly) defined as the base class for everything attaching to a _GameObject_. Confusingly enough, component scripts need to inherit from a class called [MonoBehaviour](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html) in order to be attachable to a GameObject.

In summary, in a Unity scene, a single GameObject can contain multiple components, each being an instance of a specific class. 

For example, let's say I want to create a cow in our [["Old MacDonald's Farm" VR example|2.3.1-Unity-Script-aka-C-Sharp#inheritance]]. 

I would start by creating an empty GameObject. By default an empty GameObject has two components: 
* Name: self explanatory
* Transform: Position, Rotation and Scale within the environment

After setting the Name to "Cow" and placing it where I want (i.e. setting its transform), I can now define how it looks by _attaching_ a _Mesh_ component, specifying its 3D shape. 

I could also add a _Collider_ component to it so it will block players and other animals, instead of having them pass through like ghosts.

To make it emit a sound when it "speaks", I need to attach an _AudioSource_ component to it. 

I can make it interactable by _attaching_ a custom class script that can make it respond to player actions, like so: 
```C#
public class AnimalInteraction : MonoBehaviour
{
    public void OnInteract()
    {
        // the gameObject references the gameObject to which the script
        // is attached. 
        gameObject.GetComponent<Animal>().Speak();
    }
}
```

Now this GameObject looks like a well-defined individual object. However, GameObjects can be hierarchically organized (i.e. nested) within other GameObjects. 

For example, I could create an empty GameObject that doesn't contain any Components, and call it "Herd". Then make it the _parent_ of many other _children_ cow GameObjects. This would only serve as a convenience to organize the scene and allow all children object to be moved together at once. 

## GUI
To keep track of all the GameObjects, their components, scripts,... the Unity Editor GUI is subdivided in 4 main panels: 
* Scene (Game) View
* Scene Hierarchy
* Property Inspector
* Project Explorer

![GUI](https://github.com/Doug1983/MTLab_UnitySource/blob/master/Documentation/img/Unity_GUI.jpg)

#### Scene and Game View
[Scene view](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheSceneView.html) allows free exploration of the virtual scene (right mouse button hold and w,a,s,d keyboard keys), left mouse click object selection and mouse wheel zoom. 

When the Play button is clicked, the view automatically switches to [Game view](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html), which is the actual gameplay. 

#### Scene Hierarchy
The [scene hierarchy window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html) lists all GameObjects present in the scene and their (nested) organization. Left mouse click select and right mouse to create new GameObjects. 

#### Property Inspector
The [property inspector window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html) displays information about the currently selected GameObject, its attached components and scripts, and their (public) properties. It can also be used to inspect assets such as textures or prefabs. 

#### Project Explorer
The [project explorer window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectView.html) lists all assets, such as scripts, textures, and 3D objects contained in your project directories. 

#### Animator
![Animator](https://github.com/Doug1983/MTLab_UnitySource/blob/master/Documentation/img/Animator.png)

The [animator window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimatorControllers.html) was created to control the different avatar animations required to display their physical state, such as walking, running, jumping or dying. However, at its core lies a complex system of states (grey boxes), transitions (white arrows) and conditions to control the flow of the "animations". Each state can receive "Behaviours", analogous to Components attached to GameObjects to control what happens during and between states. 

More details in the next sections.
