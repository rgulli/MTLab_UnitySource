# Installation

To simplify installation and maintenance of all the required files, everything has been made available on GitHub. The files are stored on a personal repository ([@Doug1983](https://github.com/Doug1983)) and forked on the [@JMTNeuroLab](https://github.com/JMTNeuroLab) GitHub group. To install and update the files you'll need the latest version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Unity uses the C# language which has very good integration with [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). Just make sure you install the **Game development with Unity** package when you install Visual Studio. This will allow you to have code completion and debugger access. If you already have Visual Studio, got to: `Tools/Get Tools and Features...` and install the package from there. 

## MonkeyLogic Installation
Since we are running a single task for any Unity experiment, the installation is quite simple and requires no modification from these files. 
-	Get latest MonkeyLogic zip archive version from: [https://monkeylogic.nimh.nih.gov/download.html](https://monkeylogic.nimh.nih.gov/download.html)
-	Extract archive to the installation directory of your choice (e.g. _C:\\MonkeyLogic\\_). 
-	Open the Windows command prompt or PowerShell and type: 
    * `cd C:\MonkeyLogic\task\`
    * `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/JMTNeuroLab/MTLab_ML_UnityTask.git`

-	Download the latest liblsl release for Matlab from: [https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/liblsl-Matlab/releases](https://github.com/labstreaminglayer/liblsl-Matlab/releases).
-	Extract the contents of the Liblsl for Matlab release file to:  _C:\\MonkeyLogic\\task\MTLab_ML_UnityTask\\libLSL\\bin\\_.
-	If the installation does not work (i.e. liblsl does not load in Matlab) you can run this script:  _C:\\MonkeyLogic\\task\\MTLab_ML_UnityTask\\libLSL\\build_mex.m_.

You should be all set to run MonkeyLogic and the UnityVR task!

## Unity Installation
This installs everything needed for the Unity example tasks to work, including the LabStreamingLayer for Unity scripts. 
* Get Unity Hub from [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)
* From the Unity Hub GUI, select _Installs_, click the _Add_ button and select version _2019.3.0f3_.	 
* Create a base directory for the Unity project (e.g. _C:\\UnityVRProject\\_).
* From the Windows command prompt or PowerShell:
    * `cd C:\UnityVRProject\`
    * `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Doug1983/MTLab_UnitySource.git . `

The base repository for UnitySource contains sub-modules for the Example tasks and LSL4Unity that will be downloaded automatically. 

## EyeLink SDK 
The SDK is necessary to have Unity access the EyeLink and retrieve eye samples and can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ggGMG3ZsGim3Runcfe7JXZoaC2rzDwap). **Do not download the latest SDK from the EyeLink support forums**. The above version contains a few functions not available in the one provided by SR Research. 

It also uses a specific DLL file that is provided by SR-Research without the source code. It is included in the UnitySource repository and should be in: _UnityProject\\Assets\\Scripts\\EyeLink\\DLLs\\interop.SREYELINKLib.dll_.
